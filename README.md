## Datadog APM - Java Agent and Core Tracer

Datadog APM gives you powerful tools to observe and optimize modern applications. 
It enables you to see exactly where your requests go and which services or calls are contributing to overall latency. 
The lightweight agent is designed to be deployed on every host in your infrastructure, 
so it generates gap-free distributed request traces even in the most complex microservice architectures.
 
This repository offers you all resources you needed to start to instrument your project and
gather all traces in your [Datadog](https://app.datadoghq.com) account.
