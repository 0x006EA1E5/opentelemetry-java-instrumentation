# Metric Configs

These files are copied directly from [integrations-core](https://github.com/DataDog/integrations-core/search?q=jmx_metrics&unscoped_q=jmx_metrics)
where the only modification is updating the file name.

These will be bundled in `dd-java-agent.jar`. Due to limitations in Java, it is non-trivial
to get all these files from within the jar without knowing their names.
Consequently, we list out each integration in `metricconfigs.txt` so the agent can reference them.
